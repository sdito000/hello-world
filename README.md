This is my website. I am so happy to be learning about data science because I feel like it will help me understand this rapidly developing world. I am particular interested in the study of music and what aspects of a specific song makes the listening experience of a song enjoyable. I am also studying mathematics and economics, both of which involves data in the research process. I can see a future for me particularly interested in research, since I have a steady fascination with learning new things and finding new information. I am very happy as a General course student at LSE, as I am loving the London academic culture!
